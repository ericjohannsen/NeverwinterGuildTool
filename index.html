    <title>Neverwinter Guild Tool</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This Windows program reads the guild information file generated by the command <i>/ExportGuildMemberList</i> and identifies accounts that have been inactive for a period of time that you specify. 
    It looks at all characters on the account, not individual characters, so you don't risk booting an alt that has been neglected.</p>
    <p>To use the program:
    <ul>
        <li>Log into Neverwinter with an account that has leadership priveliges in your guild.</li>
        <li>
            Type this command into chat: <i>/ExportGuildMemberList C:\Temp\MyGuild.csv</i> In this example, I have a folder called C:\Temp on my computer. You can specify any location on your computer that
            works for you.
        </li>
        <li>Run NeverwinterGuildTool</li>
        <li>Pick the file you exported from Neverwinter, e.g. C:\Temp\MyGuild.csv, using the ... button under Guild Export File, or type the file name in directly.</li>
        <li>Pick a date in the calendar indicating how recently your players need to have logged in or press one of the preset buttons for 30, 60, or 90 days.</li>
        <li>Press the Generate Kick Commands button.</li>
        <li>This will generate /guild_kick commands. The account with the oldest-most-recent login will be listed first, and all characters from a given account are listed together.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the kick commands into the game client's chat box to start kicking.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Suggestion: Before kicking users, send a guild mail letting anyone know that, if they were kicked, they are welcome to return to the guild. Users you're about to kick will still get that mail.
        I've had half a dozen players return to the game after a prolonged absence and come right back into the guild.
